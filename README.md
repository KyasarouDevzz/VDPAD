Have you ever wanted to play Dance Dance Revolution at home, but you don't want to spend 40$ on a dance pad?

No?

Weird.

I'll be making this project for people who are in the same situation as me (no arcade here has ddr)
Currently its color detection is horrible (or maybe my camera is), but here at KyasarouDevzz we accept anything, so that's progress baby!

What this project is is basically camera-based color detection and presses the key, but as stated before, it kinda sucks
