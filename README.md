Have you ever wanted to play Dance Dance Revolution at home, but you don't want to spend 40$ on a dance pad?

No?

Weird.

I'll be making this project for people who are in the same situation as me (no arcade here has ddr)
Currently it basically does nothing it literally just opens a window with a camera, but that's progress baby!

What this project is is basically camera-based color detection and presses the key, but as stated before, it does nothing rn.
